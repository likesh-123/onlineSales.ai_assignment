# Debugging

Given below is a Bash / Python script that performs following computation on an integer input (n):
- If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
Example: 4 => 16
- If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
Example: 15 => 120
- If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
Example: 25 => 15

The task is to identify the bugs in the script, fix them and share the new script. Only one of the two scripts required Bash or Python. Hint: You can correct the script by only changing less than 5 characters.
